#Lets assume that you have all of your files in one directory, for example /MDAnderon/KoayLab/Michael Li/CTPhaseProject/Data and in this CTPhase data, I have two folders (you might only need one) that are called "Arterial"
#and "Portal Venous" and within each of these two, you have a lot of folders named w*******
#Each folder representing a patient (i.e w*******) and each w******* folder containing a raw nifti file and a mask nifti file (from Total Segmentator)

#Part 1: Using Linux Command Line to extract First-Order Statistics
	#Navigate to the terminal (Click Windows Button and Type in Terminal)
	#We need a shell script to run this, in layman's A shell script is like a list of commands written in a file. When you run the script, it follows the list and does each command one by one, like a recipe
	#To name shell script that uses pyradionomics to extract the first-order statistics that we we run in the code, we need to use a .sh, to do this, type in nano example.sh (where example is the name you want)
	#Paste the following

#Start of Script (don't include this line, it just demarcates the start)

#!/bin/bash

# Define the main directories (make sure to adjust to your directories)
main_directories=("Arterial" "Portal_Venous")

# Define the base path (to get to the main directories; i.e "Arterial" and "Portal_Venous" should be in "Data)
base_path="/MDAnderon/KoayLab/Michael Li/CTPhaseProject/Data"

# Define ROI labels and their names as associative arrays (based on Total Segmentator; a full list can be found here https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator)

# Define the output CSV file ( "naming your spreadsheet".) 
master_output_csv="updated_pyradiomics_master_output.csv"

#Also, in this code, your output file will be appended to the same directory where you are running your script, if you want to specify the location, you can
