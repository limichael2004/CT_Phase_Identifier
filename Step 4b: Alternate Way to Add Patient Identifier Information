#If you are not profient in code like I am, you can very quickly and effienciently do this in your excel/.csv file as well
#Steps are as follows
#1. Open up intended master output
#2. Insert a new column to the left of the first one. This one should be now Column A
#3. Paste the following command into the command line of excel (right next to the fx symbol)
  #3...   =CEILING((ROW()-1)/2,1)

#This is basically telling it to start at row 2 (since row 1 is your column names) and for every 2 rows, increase the numbering by 1. Obviously if you have more than 2 ROI's, then adjust accordingly
#4. Click on the lower right corner of the first box in which you input the command and drag in all the way down until the bottom
