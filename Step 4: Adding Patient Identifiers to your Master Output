#Now you should have a master spreadsheet with all of the first-order statistics (Pyradiomics) that you extracted from specific ROI's (Total Segmentator).
#However, you will notice that each unique patient w******* will have X amount of rows based on how many ROI's you extracted from 
#For example, if you extracted 2 ROI's (aorta, portal_vein_and_splenic_vein), then each patient will have two rows
#The future code will treat each row as a seperate patient, so we need to add something that uniquely identifies each patient.

#We can do this through a code in Matlab, or if you have limited coding experience like I do, it can also be easily done, even for high power, in excel. I will show both ways

#Method 1: Matlab
  #To load up Matlab from the command line, type in the following
  module load matlab/r22b     #or whatever version you have (22, 23, 24, etc)
